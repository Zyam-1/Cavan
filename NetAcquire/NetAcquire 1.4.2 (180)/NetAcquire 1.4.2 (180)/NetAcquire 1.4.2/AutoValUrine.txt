We are trying to put into place a autovalidation of negative urines based on the following: 

Bacteria <150 
WCC < 40 
Age >15 yrs 
Ward - ability to exclude by ward 
Tag Repeat - ability to tag a patient to ignore the rules. 

Those that pass above would have an auto comment of "This urine has been screened using an automated urinalysis instrument and results do not meet our criteria for culture. If UTI is still suspected please resubmit a MSU and indicate on the form that this is a repeat sample and culture will be performed. 


From this we would like to produce a list of samples that failed the above rules thus creating a culture worklist. 

Thanks 

Ken
